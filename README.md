To use this code:

Save the entire code in a file named exactly Main.java
Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory containing Main.java

Compile the code:
javac Main.java

Run the compiled code:
java Main

Key changes made to fix the errors:

Moved imports to the top of the file
Defined the public class as Main
Kept Point as a static inner class
Ensured the main method is in the Main class
Removed any duplicate imports

The code should now compile and run without any errors. The output will be two lines containing the secrets for both test cases.
